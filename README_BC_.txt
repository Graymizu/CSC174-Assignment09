Planning to:
  make edit and delete on the same page for easier user access 
  add questions on to the database (make the questions reflect onto the database) 
  
Thought about:
  edit/delete 
  what if user wants to just takeout one part (considered editing as replacing a part; as delete would wipe entire file)

  Make sure that the new info is properly connencted to the database (FC-> PHP, BC-> SQL query & Bluehost database)
  Delete.html and Update.html should have a less detealed view of the database so the user doesn't have to remember what account they wanted to select
	(Should show at least name and email. Could aslo show familiarity with each cat bread)
  The Delete and Update functions should let the user know if there wasn't nothing to deleted [Sorry, accout #_ does not exist :( ]
  When updateing an account, the survey should be populated with the accounts original answers
  Create the "user" database based off the login code that was already uploaded
  
  
  
  Things to do: 
    database-rename questions 1a, 1b, 1c...etc to match database questions, make it more admin friendly to edit. 
    change first name and last name 
    email- need to make sure you have to have a @
