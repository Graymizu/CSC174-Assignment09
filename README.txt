CSC174 Assignment 9
City: Bronx

IA: Anthony Russell (IA)
Designer: Adam Struhl (DS)
Frontend Coder: Estella Kim (FC)
Backend: Lulu Chen (BC)

Things that should be added our changed for Assignment 9:

		Survey Related Page
IA/FC - Make sure that appropriate fields are required
IA/FC - Add navigation button to the "thank you message" to get back to the survey
IA    - Add more content to the survey
FC/BC - Make sure that the new info is properly connected to the database (FC-> PHP, BC-> SQL query & Bluehost database)
DS    - Design website based off of the colors in the new picture at the top of the survey page
DS    - Give the website a playful font the matches the theme of cats

		Admin Related Pages
IA/FC - Create a nav bar that sticks to the top of the screen [Home=admin, Survey, Update, Delete, Logout]
FC    - Make the database display on the admin page stay a constant size and scrollable by using JavaScript
DS    - Give these pages a more professional looking font
FC/BC - Delete.html and Update.html should have a less detailed view of the database so the user doesn't have to remember what account they wanted to select
	(Should show at least name and email. Could also show familiarity with each cat bread)	
FC/BC - The Delete and Update functions should let the user know if there wasn't nothing to deleted [Sorry, account #_ does not exist :( ]
FC/BC - When updating an account, the survey should be populated with the accounts original answers

		Login/Logout
BC    - Create the "user" database based off the login code that was already uploaded
DS    - Could you use the "cat-log.jpg" on the login and logout page
	(either as a background image or something similar to what the Facebook login page looks like)
FC    - Go through the php login code to make sure everything works smoothly
